1. Sentiment analysis (articles)
2. Get info about each player: age, injury history, stats, etc.
3. Combine stats from last season along with injury history and age
4. Factor in coaching changes

To Do:
1. Look at similar sites to see what they're doing
2. Think about what models make sense for prediction - what does IBM do for projections?


Draft Helper
For the basic version, I can use ESPN's 2024 projections. I can then perform permutations (like ESPN's mock drafts) to see which drafts tend to maximize expected fantasy points.  

For more complicated version, I need each players weekly PPR fantasy score (so I can calculate mean and standard deviation). I need to then create a drafting rule to maximize weekly performance. 

I need to model the probability that an agent will choose a player. It should be related to the projected points and the positions of the players they have chosen before. This should be easy enough to calculate. There are only so many slots for each position. The agent will fill the slots with their picked players and then calculate which draft choice maximizes the increase in their projected points. NOTE: this is the simplest version because ideally the decision would factor in the number of quality picks for open positions.
